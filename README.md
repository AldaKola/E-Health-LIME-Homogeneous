# E-Health-LIME-Homogeneous

Machine learning models have gained widespread adoption, but their lack of interpretability often poses challenges. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is crucial for assessing trust, 
especially when making decisions based on predictions or deploying new models. In this work, we introduce LIME,
a novel explanation technique that offers interpretable and faithful explanations for the predictions of any classifier. LIME achieves this by locally approximating the prediction using an interpretable model.
